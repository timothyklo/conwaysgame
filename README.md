Learn and apply something new in a constrained time period. Take no longer than 48 hours from the first commit until the last commit on your submission.

Write Conway's Game of Life in a language you are not familiar. The final solution will be executable in some format and, ideally, will include automated unit tests.

The languages you can choose from are Elm, Rust, Elixir, Clojure, Swift, or Go. Similar with the last challenge, this is not a about the finish line, its about the process, research, approach, and quality of the final code.
